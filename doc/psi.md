<!-- run -->
```shell
$ replicated login
```

<!-- output -->
```text
Replicated will request an API token for vendor.replicated.com using your browser.

If login is successful, Replicated will store the token in plain text in
the following file for use by subsequent commands:
    /Users/dex/.replicated.d/credentials.yaml

Do you want to proceed?
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

```

![create-token](./img/create-token.png)

![copy-token](./img/copy-token.png)

<!-- output -->
```text
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replicated must now open a web browser to the tokens page for vendor.replicated.com.

If a browser does not open this automatically, open the following URL to proceed:

    https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings#user-api-tokens?source=replicated-login

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate a token using your browser, and copy-paste it into this prompt.

Terraform will store the token in plain text in the following file
for use by subsequent commands:
    /Users/dex/.replicated.d/credentials.yaml

Token for vendor.replicated.com
  Enter a value: ðŸ”‘

Created skeleton helm application in ./app-8008

In the future, to bootstrap an application with an existing helm chart, run:

    replicated app create NAME --directory=path/to/chart

```

<!-- run -->
```shell
$ export REPLICATED_APP=${USER}-test

<!-- 

Give a path to a directory to create. In this case we'll bootstrap an app similar to the default nginx chart, or maybe use a library chart?

Later in the guide, we'll teach you to bootstrap with your own chart
